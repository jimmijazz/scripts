This could be used to track how much a customer spends in a year to reject discount codes or offer promotions
You also need a Shopify flow that can tag the customer any time a new order is created with the format {{order.createdAt}}--{{order.totalPriceSet.shopMoney.amount}}
Date needs to be updated each year. It also assume we reset on Jan 1 of each year.
